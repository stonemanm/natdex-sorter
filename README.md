# National Dex Sorter

At least three times now, I've found myself wanting to sort a list of Pokémon names, but unable to find any automatic ways to do so aside from alphabetizing, which has the unfortunate side effect of separating Pokémon that ought to be adjacent (Ivysaur and Venusaur, say).

So I made (am making?) this to fix that.
